Things to discuss with attendees...

** Mike

A declarative way to bind extensions to namespace URIs.  To be able to
bind a Java method to an HTTP URI, as http://exslt.org/v2/http-client.
Using a property, or a command line option.

Actually, that's not just Mike, but also other XSLT and XQuery
implementors (Norm, maybe others) to think about a way to allow one to
simply, declaratively evaluate a stylesheet or a query using an
extension, identified only by its namespace URI (no Java class name as
in Saxon, no module filename as in ML, only the namespace URI.)


** Jeni

Talk about XSpec and XTC, about the processing model (each test is a
transform, throwing an error in case of failure,) about the assertions
(being able to write your own, comparison of "templates", using an
embedded vocabulary...)


** TODO

- Deployment system (see above.)

- eXist implem
